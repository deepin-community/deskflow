Description: Mouse and keyboard sharing utility
 Deskflow is a free and open source keyboard and mouse sharing app
 formerly known as Synergy Community Edition.
 .
 Use the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad of one computer to control nearby
 computers, and work seamlessly between them.
 .
 Deskflow is oriented cross-platform and supports all major operating
 systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix-like BSD-derived
 which supports Wayland and has kindly configuration wizard feature
 because it is also upstream of commercial fork of Synergy and it can
 be expected continuous maintenance somewhat.
 .
 Deskflow provides similar UI like Barrier so transition to Deskflow
 is easy.
