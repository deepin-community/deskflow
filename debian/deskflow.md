# NAME

deskflow - Mouse and keyboard sharing utility

# SYNOPSIS

**deskflow**

# DESCRIPTION

Deskflow is a free and open source keyboard and mouse sharing app
formerly known as Synergy Community Edition.

Use the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad of one computer to control nearby
computers, and work seamlessly between them.

Deskflow is oriented cross-platform and supports all major operating
systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix-like BSD-derived
which supports Wayland and has kindly configuration wizard feature
because it is also upstream of commercial fork of Synergy and it can
be expected continuous maintenance somewhat. 

Deskflow provides similar UI like Barrier so transition to Deskflow is easy.

This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

# OPTIONS
